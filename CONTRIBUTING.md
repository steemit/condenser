## Contributing to Condenser

Everyone is welcome to contribute code to Steemit, Inc. projects. We have a Code of Conduct; we ask that you please follow it in all your interactions with our team and your fellow contributors.

### How to contribute

1. **Reporting Bugs**: If you encounter a bug or unexpected behavior, please file an issue to report it. Please include, if possible: a description of what happened, the URL of the page, the browser you're using, a screenshot of the bug or error message, and any relevant console output.
2. **Enhancement Suggestions**: If you have an enhancement suggestion, file an issue in this repo. Be clear in describing what problem you are trying to solve or the enhancement to existing functionality youâ€™d like to see. Our team will review your issue and offer feedback, accept it for internal development, or recommend community development.
3. **Development Discussions**: Developers may open issues to discuss proposed changes. This is to inform the community of potential changes, and to get input from the community and other developers on the implementation.
4. **Pull Requests**: We love community contributions. If you've done some work on an issue and want to see it in the Condenser codebase, please submit a Pull Request, reference the issue in the description and start the title with `community -`. We're working very hard to keep our development practices as open as possible, and this helps us a lot. PRs which include tests, format code to existing conventions, and include documentation generally receive top priority.
   If one of our teammates asks you to make changes, please make them. All comments in code review must be resolved or addressed. Our teammates follow this rule too! And remember, you are agreeing to license your code and any intellectual property associated with your code under the same terms as the repository you are contributing to.

## Code of Conduct

Again, please note that this Code of Conduct only applies to our development presence.

## Contributing to Condenser

Everyone is welcome to contribute code to Steemit, Inc. projects. We have a Code of Conduct; we ask that you please follow it in all your interactions with our team and your fellow contributors.

### How to contribute

1. **Reporting Bugs**: If there is an existing feature that is not working correctly, or a glitch in the website that is impacting user behavior, please file an issue to report it. Bug reports must include, at a minimum, the following information: the environment in which you encountered the bug. In the case of a Web application, this includes the URL, date and time of access, the name and version of the operating system and browser you’re using. In the case of a client library or other program, this includes a full stack trace as well as a representative example of the triggering code.
2. **Enhancement Suggestions**: If you have an enhancement you would like to see in Condenser, file it as an issue in this repo. Be clear in describing what problem you are trying to solve or enhancement to existing functionality you’d like to see. Our team will review your issue and offer feedback, accept it for internal development, or recommend community development.
3. **Development Discussions**: The developers frequently open issues to discuss changes that are being worked on. This is to inform the community of the changes being worked on, and to get input from the community and other developers on the implementation. 
4. **Pull Requests**: We love community contributions. If you've done some work on an issue and want to see it in the Condenser codebase, please submit a Pull Request, reference the issue in the description and start the title with `community -`. We're working very hard to keep our development practices as open as possible, and this helps us a lot. If one of our teammates asks you to make changes, please make them. All comments in code review must be resolved or addressed. Our teammates follow this rule too! PRs which include tests, format code to existing conventions, and include documentation usually receive top priority. Remember, you are agreeing to license your code and any intellectual property associated with your code under the same terms as the repository you are contributing to.

## Code of Conduct

Again, please note that this Code of Conduct only applies to our development presence.

# Please Read

Please read these instructions before submitting issues or pull requests to the Steemit.com (**condenser**) GitHub repository. The issue tracker is the place to start for all for bugs and well vetted enhancements.

## Bug Reports

If there is an existing feature that is not working correctly, or a glitch in the website that is impacting user behaviour - please open an issue to report variance. Include as much relevant information as you can, including screen shots and steps to reproduce the issue.

## Technical Support and Signup/Login Issues

If you are having trouble using the website but it is not an error with the website (this includes signup/login issues), do **not** open a GitHub issue. Please request help from the users in the [steemit.chat help](https://steemit.chat/channel/help) channel.

## Enhancement Suggestions

If you have an enhancement you would like to see in condenser we suggest you first discuss it with other members of the 
community on Steemit.com, or in the steemit discord channel. If there is a well vetted idea that has the support of the 
community create an issue with a link to the discussion, a detailed description, and tag it with the label `new_grass` 
(for 'grass roots', and 'the grass is greener'). New enhancement issues that do not follow this format will be closed.

**Bumps for working code:** Community contributions are still tops. If there's a `new_grass` labeled issue you like or 
want to promote, fork the repo and code away! (leave a comment saying as much with a link to your repo/branch) When 
you've got it ready post another comment and tag `@sneak` in it. If it passes muster you'll be invited to create a Pull Request.

## Implementation Discussion

The developers frequently open issues to discuss changes that are being worked on. This is to inform the community of the changes being worked on, and to get input from the community and other developers on the implementation.

Issues opened that devolve into lengthy discussion of minor site features will be closed or locked.  The issue tracker is not a general purpose discussion forum. (That's what steemit.com is for!)

## Duplicate Issues

Please do a keyword search to see if there is already an existing issue before opening a new one.

## Steemit.com vs. Steem Blockchain

This issue tracker is only intended to track issues for the Steemit.com website. If the issue is with the 
Steem blockchain, please open an issue in the [Steem Repository](https://github.com/steemit/steem).

## Pull Requests

We love working code, but please do not open a Pull Request unless all the conditions in the **Bumps for working code:**
section have been met.

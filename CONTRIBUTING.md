# Contributing to Condenser

Everyone is welcome to contribute code to Steemit, Inc. projects. We have a Code of Conduct;
we ask that you please follow it in all your interactions with our team and your fellow
contributors.

Please note that this contributing guide only applies to our development presence.

## How to contribute

1. File an issue describing the problem you would like to
   solve or the feature you would like to add. It saves unnecessary work on your part, 
   in case there's a nontechnical reason we can't accept a particular change.
   Please note that we can and will _automatically close all pull requests that do not refer to
   an issue_.
2. Learn the conventions of the project you are submitting code to, even implicit ones,
   and follow them. In case you have a question about a project's conventions, please
   ask on the issue you filed. This includes writing tests, formatting code, and documentation.
3. File a pull request against your Github issue and fill out the pull request template.
   Remember, you are agreeing to license your code and any intellectual property associated
   with your code under the same terms as the repository you are contributing to.
4. If one of our teammates asks you to make changes, please make them. Our rule is that all
   requests for changes in code review are resolved in favor of the reviewer. Our teammates
   follow this rule too!   
5. **Reporting Bugs** If there is an existing feature that is not working correctly, or a 
    glitch in the website that is impacting user behaviour - please open an issue to report 
    variance. Include as much relevant information as you can, including screen shots and 
    steps to reproduce the issue.
6. **Enhancement Suggestions** If you have an enhancement you would like to see in condenser 
    we suggest you first discuss it with other members of the community on Steemit.com, or 
    in the steemit discord channel. If there is a well vetted idea that has the support of 
    the community create an issue with a link to the discussion. The issue's title should
    start with `community -` and have a detailed description.
7. **Development Discussions** The developers frequently open issues to discuss changes that 
    are being worked on. This is to inform the community of the changes being worked on, and 
    to get input from the community and other developers on the implementation.    
8. **Pull Requests** We love community contributions. If you've done some work on an issue
     and want to see it in the condenser codebase, please submit a Pull Request, reference
     the issue in the description start the title with `community -`. We're working very
     hard to keep our development practices as open as possible, and this helps us a lot. 
9. **Translations** Becoming a translator for your native language is easy and a great help to
     users around the world. To add your native language contributions for an existing or new 
     language, please email translate@steemit.com to receive your email invite. Translators are 
     able to join existing translated languages or submit a new language. Please do not submit 
     Pull Requests with your updates, all key string updates should always be added first in 
     our translations platform.

                            </p><p className="c0"><span className="c1">10.1. &nbsp;As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things, provide in-browser (or otherwise local) software that (a) generates and stores STEEM ACCOUNT Addresses and encrypted Private Keys (defined below), and (b) Facilitates the submission of STEEM transaction data to the Steem network without requiring you to access the STEEM command line interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                            </p><p className="c0"><span className="c1">10.2. &nbsp;Account Names and Private Keys. When you create an Account, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive STEEM and Steem Dollars via the Steem network.. The Private Key uniquely matches the Account Name and must be used in connection with the Account Name to authorize the transfer of STEEM and Steem Dollars from that Account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Private Key and any password phrase associated with your wallet. You must keep your Account, password phrase and Private Key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollars associated with the Wallet.</span>
                            </p><p className="c0"><span className="c1">10.3. &nbsp;No Password Retrieval. Steemit does not receive or store your Account password, nor the unencrypted keys and addresses. Therefore, we cannot assist you with Account password retrieval. Our Services provide you with tools to help you remember or recover your password, including by allowing you to set password hints, but the Services cannot generate a new password for your Account. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Account Names and password pairs maintained in your Account, you accept and acknowledge that any STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power you have associated with such Account will become inaccessible if you do not have your Account password.</span>
                            </p><p className="c0"><span className="c1">10.4. &nbsp;Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Steem transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Steem public ledger via the Steem distributed consensus network (a peer-to-peer economic network that operates on a cryptographic protocol), which is not owned, controlled or operated by Steemit. The Steem Network is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. Blockchain has no control over the Steem network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the Steem network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Steem network. You may use the Services to submit these details to the network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

Steem, in any of its forms (STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power) is an intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the Steem network. The Service does not store, send or receive Steem. Any transfer of title that might occur in any STEEM, Steem Dollars or Steem Power occurs on the decentralized ledger within the Steem network and not within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service can effect the transfer of title or right in any Steem, Steem Dollars or Steem Power.</span>
                            </p><p className="c0"><span className="c1">10.6. &nbsp;Relationship. Nothing in these Terms is intended to nor shall create any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy or trusteeship, you and Steemit being with respect to one another independent contractors.</span>
                            </p><p className="c0"><span className="c1">10.7. &nbsp;Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that Steemit is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Steem transaction initiated via the Services, for instance, if you mistype an Account Name or otherwise provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.</span>
                            </p><p className="c0"><span className="c1">10.8. &nbsp;No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Steem network via the Services, The Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. Steemit has no control over the Steem Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.</span>
                            </p><p className="c0"><span className="c1">10.9. &nbsp;Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Steemit is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Steem transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Steem transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

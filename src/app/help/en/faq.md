# General

## <span id="What_is_Steemit_com">What is steemit.com?</span>

Steemit has redefined social media by building a living, breathing, and growing social economy - a community where users are rewarded for sharing their voice. It's a new kind of attention economy.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_Steemit_work">How does Steemit work?</span>

Steemit.com is one of the many websites (including [Busy.org](https://busy.org/), [DTube](https://d.tube/), and [Utopian.io](https://utopian.io/)) that are powered by the Steem blockchain and STEEM cryptocurrency. All of these websites read and write content to the Steem blockchain, which stores the content in an immutable blockchain ledger, and rewards users for their contributions with digital tokens called STEEM.

Every day, the Steem blockchain mints new STEEM tokens and adds them to a community's "rewards pool". These tokens are then awarded to users for their contributions, based on the votes that their content receives. Users who hold more tokens in their account as "Steem Power" will get to decide where a larger portion of the rewards pool is distributed.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_Steemit_differ_from_other_social_media_websites">How does Steemit differ from other social media websites?</span>

While most social media sites extract this value for the benefit of their shareholders, Steemit believes that the users of the platform should receive the benefits and rewards for their attention and the contributions they make to the platform.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_I_need_to_do_in_order_to_secure_my_account">What do I need to do in order to secure my account?</span>

Unlike most social media websites, **there is no way to recover your account if you lose your password / owner key!** This is why it is extremely important that you save and backup your password somewhere safe. It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper stored in a fireproof safe. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

If you leak your private key to another user or a third-party website, that user or website will have full access to your account. This means they can steal it, as well as the funds inside of it. It is therefore not recommended to enter your private key information with any other user or third-party website. If you believe your account has been compromised, you should change your password/keys right away.

Each account has multiple keys, which each have different levels of authority: owner, active, posting, and memo. The information on the different types of keys and their purposes, as well as more information on password and key security, can be found in the section on <a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">Security</a>.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Does_it_cost_anything_to_post__comment__or_vote">Does it cost anything to post, comment, or vote?</span>

No. It is free to post, comment, and vote on content on steemit.com. You might even get paid for it!

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_earn_digital_tokens_on_Steemit_How">Can I earn digital tokens on Steemit? How?</span>

You can earn digital tokens on Steemit by:

**Posting** - By sharing your posts, you can earn upvotes from community members. Depending on the upvotes you receive, you may get a portion of the "rewards pool".

**Voting and curating** - If you discover a post and upvote it before it becomes popular, you can earn a curation reward. The reward amount will depend on the amount of Steem Power you have.

**Purchasing** - Users can purchase STEEM or Steem Dollar tokens directly through their Steemit wallet using bitcoin, Ether, or BitShares tokens. They are also available from other markets and exchanges including [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), [BitShares](https://openledger.info/), [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com), [BlockTrades](https://blocktrades.us), [Changelly](https://changelly.com), [GOPAX](https://www.gopax.co.kr), [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/), [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com), [Shapeshift.io](https://shapeshift.io), and [UpBit](https://upbit.com/).

**Interest** - STEEM tokens that are powered up to Steem Power will earn a small amount of interest for holding.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Where_do_the_tokens_come_from">Where do the tokens come from?</span>

The Steem network continually creates new digital tokens to reward content creators and curators. Some of the newly-created tokens are transferred to users who add value to Steem by posting, commenting, and voting on other people's posts. The remainder is distributed to holders of Steem Power and the witnesses that power the blockchain.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Where_does_the_value_come_from">Where does the value come from?</span>

At its root, Steem is simply a points system. However, because this points system is blockchain-based, the points can be traded on markets as tokens. People buy and sell these tokens, and many hold in anticipation of increased purchasing power for various Steem-related services.

By analogy, Steem is a game system where users compete for attention and rewards by bringing content and adding value to the platform. The rewards people earn are tokens that have market value and are readily tradable. It is similar to how someone playing a video game could obtain a limited item or currency by playing the game. If the currency or items are transferable between users, then they can sell or buy them on game item markets.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="Why_are_people_getting_vastly_different_rewards">Why are people getting vastly different rewards?</span>

Steemit is not a "get rich quick" scheme. While it is possible to post content that goes viral quickly and earn a lot of rewards on a single post, this is not typical for most users.

Most of the authors that you see earning high rewards are users that have spent a lot of time in the network building followings, making connections with others, and developing a reputation for bringing high quality content.

It is best to have realistic expectations, without focusing on rewards when you are first starting out. Work on building a following, making connections, and developing a good reputation. Consistency will pay off in the long run.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
## <span id="What_are_Smart_Media_Tokens_SMTs">What are Smart Media Tokens (SMTs)?</span>

A Smart Media Token (SMT) is a native digital asset on the Steem blockchain that can be quickly launched by anyone to help monetize online content and create incentives to encourage desired user behavior.

They're like Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens, but with certain built-in ‘Proof-of-Brain’ properties and a token distribution reward system designed specifically for digital content businesses.

SMTs are planned to be launched in 2018!

More information can be found on the SMTs website: [smt.steem.io](https://smt.steem.io/).

## <span id="Why_do_I_need_to_provide_my_email_and_phone_number">Why do I need to provide my email and phone number?</span>

To create an account on the blockchain, it costs STEEM tokens. When you create an account through steemit.com, Steemit Inc. is supplying the tokens to pay the account creation fee. In order to prevent users from abusing the paid-for signup and creating multiple accounts, we need to be able to verify that each user is only signing up for one account.

## <span id="Can_I_create_a_Steem_account_without_an_email_and_phone_number">Can I create a Steem account without an email and phone number?</span>

The only way to have an account created via steemit.com is to supply your email and phone number. Because Steem is an open and permissionless network, there are other ways to create an account. Any Steem blockchain account can be used on steemit.com.

If you are willing to pay your own signup fee, then there are other ways to create a new account on the blockchain.

There is a third-party tool called <a href="https://www.SteemCreate.com">SteemCreate</a> that accepts credit cards, or BTC to create a Steem account. You do not need to have an existing Steem blockchain account to use the service, but there is a charge on top of the blockchain account creation fee for using the service.

There is a third-party tool called <a href="https://blocktrades.us/create-steem-account">BlockTrades</a> that accepts bitcoin, Litecoin, STEEM, SBD, BitShares, Dash, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and more to create a Steem account. You can also send extra tokens to pre-load the account with additional Steem Power. You do not need to have an existing Steem blockchain account to use the service, but there is a charge on top of the blockchain account creation fee for using the service.

There is a third-party tool called <a href="https://anon.steem.network/">AnonSteem</a> that accepts bitcoin, Litecoin, STEEM, or SBD to anonymously create a Steem account. You do not need to have an existing Steem blockchain account to use the service, but there is a charge on top of the blockchain account creation fee for using the service.

There is a third-party tool called <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@timcliff/new-tool-from-busy-org-create-new-steem-blockchain-accounts-with-steemconnect">SteemConnect</a> that allows you to create accounts by paying or delegating the account creation fee.

## <span id="Am_I_required_to_verify_my_identity">Am I required to verify my identity?</span>

Verification is a process where users give evidence to show that they are the person that they claim to be.  This is to reduce fraud and people impersonating known figures. If you would like to remain anonymous, that is perfectly fine. However if you claim to be someone specific, the community may expect that you verify you are who you say you are.

There are a number of ways to do this. The most common way to verify your identity is by posting a link to your Steemit profile on a website or social media account which you are already known for having such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, a blog, or photography site.

Many users also like to post a photo or a video which shows them holding up a sheet of paper with the current date and their Steem account name handwritten on it. This is a great way to add a personal touch to verifying.

## <span id="What_are_tags">What are tags?</span>

Tags are a way to categorize your content, so that others can find it. The more relevant the tags are to the post, the more like-minded people will come across it.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
## <span id="What_tags_should_I_use">What tags should I use?</span>

Try to use tags that are relevant to your post, and that will be popular for other people to browse. For example, "mytriptoalaska" may be relevant to your post, but readers are probably not going to go searching for that. Using "travel" would be a better choice for a tag in this case.

You can browse through commonly used tags using the "Explore" link, in the main menu.

Be mindful when choosing tags. If your tags aren’t related to your post, your post may get downvotes for mistagging.

All tags must be lowercase letters. Spaces aren't allowed, but hyphenated words with a single dash are.

## <span id="How_often_can_I_post">How often can I post?</span>

You are allowed to post almost as often as you like. Currently, posts must be spaced 5 minutes apart. However, the community may not find value in users that are posting too frequently.

## <span id="How_long_can_my_post_be">How long can my post be?</span>

Post sizes are limited to about 64,000 characters including formatting. This is ample for most posts. If writing blogs, consider how much people are willing to read at one time. If you make your posts too long, readers may lose interest which may affect the amount of upvotes and rewards you receive.

## <span id="Can_I_delete_something_I_posted">Can I delete something I posted?</span>

The blockchain will always contain the full edit history of posts and comments, so it can never be completely deleted. If you would like to update a post so that users cannot see the content via steemit.com, you can edit the post and replace it with blank content for as long as the post is active. After seven days, the post can no longer be edited.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
## <span id="What_does__Promoting__a_post_do">What does "Promoting" a post do?</span>

When you make a post, there is the option to promote it with Steem Dollars. It will then show up in the “Promoted” tab. The order that it appears in the list depends on how much the post was promoted for. Posts with a higher promoted amount will be higher than posts with less.

Steem Dollars spent to promote a post are paid to the account @null, which nobody owns or controls. Once a user transfers SBD to @null, the Steem blockchain removes them from the currency supply. Details can be found in this <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitblog/introducing-promoted-content">official post</a>.

You can promote your own posts, or posts that you like from other users.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_I_promote_a_post">How do I promote a post?</span>

At the bottom of each post is a button to "Promote". After clicking the button, type the number of Steem Dollars that you want to spend and click “PROMOTE”. The operation will require your master password or active key.

# Economics

## <span id="Where_do_the_new_STEEM_tokens_come_from">Where do the new STEEM tokens come from?</span>

Blockchains like Steem and Bitcoin produce new tokens each time a block is produced. Unlike Bitcoin, where all of the new coins go to the block producers (called miners), the Steem blockchain allocates a majority of the new tokens to a reward fund called the "rewards pool". The rewards pool gives users tokens for participating in the platform based on the value they add.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_many_new_tokens_are_generated_by_the_blockchain">How many new tokens are generated by the blockchain?</span>

Starting with the network's 16th hard fork in December 2016, Steem began creating new tokens at a yearly inflation rate of 9.5%. The inflation rate decreases at a rate of 0.01% every 250,000 blocks, or about 0.5% per year. The inflation will continue decreasing at this pace until the overall inflation rate reaches 0.95%. This will take about 20.5 years from the time hard fork 16 went into effect.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_are_the_new_tokens_distributed">How are the new tokens distributed?</span>

Out of the new tokens that are generated:
- 75% go to the reward pool, which is split between authors and curators.
- 15% of the new tokens are awarded to holders of Steem Power.
- The remaining 10% pays for the witnesses to power the blockchain.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="Which_exchanges_are_STEEM_and_SBD_listed_on">Which exchanges are STEEM and SBD listed on?</span>

STEEM and SBD are listed on the following exchanges:

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_reward_pool">What is the reward pool?</span>

Every day, a fixed amount of STEEM tokens are allocated to the network reward fund, commonly called the "reward pool." These get distributed to authors and curators for posting and voting on content.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_the_reward_pool_split_between_authors_and_curators">How is the reward pool split between authors and curators?</span>

Up to 25% of a post's payout is awarded to curators (the people who upvoted the post) as a reward for discovering the content. The other 75% is awarded to the author.

If curators vote for a post within the first 30 minutes of it being created, a portion of their curation reward is added to the author payout. This portion is linear to the age of the post between 0 and 30 minutes. As an example: upvoting at 15 minutes will donate half of your potential curation reward to the author.

## <span id="Will_the_reward_pool_pay_out_more_or_less_depending_on_who_votes">Will the reward pool pay out more or less depending on who votes?</span>

There is a fixed amount of STEEM coins that gets added to the rewards pool each day. In the short term, the amount of coins that get paid out may be higher or lower depending on the amount of voting activity, but over time it will pay out the full amount of rewards regardless of who votes.

Votes in Steem are stake-weighted. Therefore voters with more Steem Power have a greater influence over the allocation than voters with less SP, but their votes do not increase the amount of rewards in the rewards pool.

## <span id="Why_do_the_earnings_for_my_post_go_up_or_down">Why do the earnings for my post go up or down?</span>

The amount that is shown next to a post is a "**Potential Payout**". This is an estimated value of how much money the post will make based on the votes that have occurred so far. Depending on various factors, this value can go up or down until the payout window closes:

- If a post receives more upvotes, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If a post receives more downvotes, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If other posts receive more upvotes, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If other posts receive more downvotes, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If upvotes are removed from a post, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If downvotes are removed from a post, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If the price of STEEM goes up, the potential payout of all posts can go up.
- If the price of STEEM goes down, the potential payout of all posts can go down.

## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_STEEM__STEEM_Power__and_Steem_Dollars">What is the difference between STEEM, Steem Power, and Steem Dollars?</span>

**STEEM** - STEEM is the base liquid currency token in the platform. STEEM can be powered up into Steem Power, traded for Steem Dollars, or transferred to other accounts. It is a cryptocurrency token, similar to bitcoin.

**Steem Power** - Steem Power (abbreviated SP) is a measurement of how much influence a user has in the Steem network. The more Steem Power a user holds, the more they can influence the value of posts and comments. Steem Power is less liquid. If a user wishes to “Power Down” SP, they will receive equal distributions of the STEEM weekly, over a 13 week period.

**Steem Dollars** - Steem Dollars (commonly abbreviated SBD) are liquid stable-value currency tokens designed to be pegged to $1 USD. Steem Dollars can be traded with STEEM, and transferred to other accounts for commerce or exchange.  Steem Dollars may also be converted into STEEM via a process that takes 3.5 days. Steem Dollars can be used to buy things in marketplaces, such as [The Steemit Shop](https://thesteemitshop.com/).

## <span id="What_is_delegated_STEEM_Power">What is delegated Steem Power?</span>

Users have the option to delegate Steem Power to other users. When a user is delegated Steem Power - their bandwidth, content votes, and curation rewards are calculated as if it were their own Steem Power. Users are not able to power down or cash out delegated Steem Power however, as it still belongs to the original owner.

Most users will have a small amount of Steem Power delegated to them by the Steemit account after creating an account via steemit.com.

Delegated Steem Power shows up in a user's wallet below their actual Steem Power balance in parentheses.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_determines_the_price_of_STEEM">What determines the price of STEEM?</span>

The price of STEEM is based on the supply and demand of the token, as determined by buyers and sellers on the exchanges. It is similar to how the price of a commodity like gold is determined.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_I_get_more_STEEM_Power">How do I get more Steem Power?</span>

With STEEM tokens in your wallet, click "Power Up" to turn them into Steem Power. If you have Steem Dollars, you can convert them to STEEM from your wallet, and then power up the STEEM.

If you don’t already have STEEM or Steem Dollars in your wallet, you can purchase them using bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), or BitShares (BTS) tokens. You may purchase BTC on various exchanges, such as Coinbase.com or Localbitcoins.com.

To buy:
- Click "Buy Steem" from the main menu in the top right corner of steemit.com, or from your wallet.
- Select the currency to deposit, and enter the amount of that currency you wish to use.
- Enter your Steemit account name (without the @) for "Your receive address".
- Click the "Get Deposit Address" button.
- Send the currency to the provided address.

STEEM purchases made via steemit.com are facilitated by <a href="https://blocktrades.us">BlockTrades</a>.

bitcoin can also be exchanged for STEEM on external markets such as [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), [BitShares](https://openledger.info/), [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com), [Changelly](https://changelly.com), [GOPAX](https://www.gopax.co.kr), [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/), [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com), [Shapeshift.io](https://shapeshift.io), and [UpBit](https://upbit.com/).

Transactions on the Steem blockchain typically only take about three seconds to process, but when you are purchasing the STEEM tokens using bitcoin or some other token, then the transaction must wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the other network. This can take several hours, and sometimes even days.    

If you paid using bitcoin, the third party website <a href="https://bitcoinfees.21.co/">bitcoinfees.21.co</a> can estimate the approximate wait time of the transaction based on the fees that were paid. The third party website <a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain.info</a> will lookup the fees that were paid on a specific blockchain transaction.

## <span id="What_is_powering_up_and_down">What is powering up and down?</span>

**Powering up** - If you have STEEM tokens, you can Power Up to Steem Power to get more voting influence on posts and comments. Having more Steem Power also increases the amount of curation rewards and interest that you can earn. More SP also grants more influence on approving Steem witnesses.

**Powering down** - If you have Steem Power, you can power down to turn it into liquid STEEM over a period of time. The system will transfer 1/13 of your Steem Power to STEEM each week for about three months (13 weeks), starting 1 week from the time it is started. However, you will lose your influence in the network proportionally to how much is powered down, so think about it carefully. Power downs can be stopped at any time.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_the_dollar_amounts_for_pending_payouts_represent">What do the dollar amounts for pending payouts represent?</span>

The dollar amounts next to posts and comments are estimates of the potential payout that will occur when the payout period ends, based on the current voting activity and price of STEEM. These potential payout amounts may fluctuate up or down until the payout period ends.

Payouts occur as a combination of Steem Power and Steem Dollars. Sometimes the blockchain may substitute STEEM in place of the Steem Dollars based on market conditions.

The blockchain estimates the dollar value of STEEM and Steem Power based on the 3.5 day average price of STEEM reported by the witnesses. The blockchain assumes Steem Dollars are worth approximately one USD.

## <span id="Will_1_Steem_Dollar_always_be_worth__1_00_USD">Will 1 Steem Dollar always be worth $1.00 USD?</span>

The market value of a Steem Dollar is dictated by the supply and demand of the token. Therefore it is possible for 1 SBD to be worth more or less than 1 USD depending on market conditions.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
## <span id="How_do_Steem_Dollar_to_STEEM_conversions_work">How do Steem Dollar to STEEM conversions work?</span>

If you convert Steem Dollars to STEEM, the blockchain will process the transaction over a period of 3.5 days. At the end of the 3.5 days, the SBD will be gone and replaced by approximately $1 USD worth of STEEM tokens. The "approximately 1 USD worth of STEEM tokens" is based on the median STEEM price over the 3.5 days, using the price feeds from the Steem witnesses. Depending on price fluctuations during the 3.5 days it is possible to end up with more or less than $1 USD worth of STEEM per SBD at the end of the conversion. This is an advanced user feature, and is currently only available to users using external wallets.

No, you are not being paid by Steemit. The Steem network rewards you. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you make. Further, it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. By creating an account, you agree that Steemit, Inc. is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Steem transactions, or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Steem transactions.

# Voting and Curating

## <span id="What_is_my_voting_power">What is my voting power?</span>

Voting power is like an "energy bar" in a computer game that goes down a little bit every time you vote. You start out with 100% voting power. Every time you vote, you will use a small amount of your voting power.

As you use more of your voting power, your votes will carry less influence. A vote with 50% voting power left will be worth 1/2 as much as a vote cast with 100% voting power. Not to worry, the network recharges your voting power by 20% every day.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="How_many_times_can_I_vote_without_depleting_my_voting_power">How many times can I vote without depleting my voting power?</span>

Every 100% vote you cast will use 2% of your remaining voting power. Your voting power will recharge by 20% each day. You can vote more than 10 times per day, but each vote will be worth less, and it will take longer to reach full voting power again.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_vote_with_less_than_100__of_my_voting_strength">Can I vote with less than 100% of my voting strength?</span>

New users can only upvote and downvote with 100% voting strength.

Once you reach about 500 Steem Power, you will see a vote slider appear when you vote. You can use the slider to adjust the weight of your vote, between 1% and 100% voting strength. Voting with less than 100% voting weight will use up less voting power, but it will also have less of an influence on the post or comment's rewards.

<img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmV6c21tzSrgXwPHx4tvuc1UiCXBEvzkLBH9QCZHtVN6Ma/image.png">

Upvotes and downvotes use the same amount of voting power.

## <span id="Where_can_I_check_my_voting_power">Where can I check my voting power?</span>

You can view your current voting power using third party tools such as https://steemd.com/@youraccount.

## <span id="What_determines_how_much_of_the_curation_reward_goes_to_the_author_versus_curators">What determines how much of the curation reward goes to the author versus curators?</span>

The rewards are allocated so that 75% of the payout goes to the author of the post/comment, and 25% goes to the curator.

Of the 25% that goes to the curator, that portion will be split between the author and the curator if the curator votes within the first 30 minutes. The split of the 25% between the author and curator during the first 30 minutes is calculated linearly based on the time the vote is cast.

- If a post is upvoted the moment of posting, 100% of the curation reward goes to the author.
- At 3 minutes, 90% goes to the author and 10% to the curator.
- At 15 minutes it's a 50/50 split.
- At 27 minutes, 10% goes to the author and 90% to the curator.
- If a post is upvoted 30 min after posting, 100% of the curation reward goes to the curator.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Can_I_get_curation_rewards_for_upvoting_comments">Can I get curation rewards for upvoting comments?</span>

Yes. You can earn curation rewards from upvoting both posts and comments!

## <span id="Do_I_get_curation_rewards_for_downvoting_posts_or_comments">Do I get curation rewards for downvoting posts or comments?</span>

No. Since downvoting reduces the rewards on a post/comment, it does not earn curation rewards.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="What_are_curation_trails">What are curation trails?</span>

Some users decide to use third party applications such as <a href="https://streemian.com/">Streemian</a> to automatically cast votes. Users can automatically vote for the same posts and comments that other users does. Typically they will set this up to follow the votes of users who are good at curating. When a user has other users automatically voting for the same content that they do, the people that automatically vote after them are called their "curation trail".

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Why_don_t_my_upvotes_have_an_effect_on_a_post_s_rewards">Why don't my upvotes have an effect on a post's rewards?</span>

A user with more SP is going to have a larger influence on the rewards than users with less SP. One vote from a user with a lot of SP can often have more of an effect than 100 votes from users with a small amount of SP.

Even though your vote may not have an immediate effect, when it gets added in along with all the other votes at the end of the payout period, it can still affect the payout. It may also cause more users to vote on the post too, because they saw that you upvoted it - so your votes can have an indirect effect on the payout this way.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
## <span id="Is_there_a_way_to_make_my_votes_count_for_more">Is there a way to make my votes count for more?</span>

Yes. The more Steem Power you have, the more influence your votes will have.

The platform does not require that anybody purchase SP in order to participate, and there are many users who have earned a lot of Steem Power without spending any of their own money. You have the option of purchasing more Steem Power through your Steemit wallet.

## <span id="What_are_the_valid_reasons_for_downvoting">What are the valid reasons for downvoting?</span>

Users are allowed to downvote for any reason that they want. There are many users in the community who recommend only using the downvote on posts that are abusive. It is up to you if you want to follow this etiquette.

## <span id="Does_a_downvote_mean_that_I_did_something_wrong">Does a downvote mean that I did something wrong?</span>

Just because you received a downvote does not mean that you did something wrong. The downvoting person may have just been voting to reallocate the rewards in a way that they felt was more beneficial to the other active posts in the platform. Often users will leave a comment explaining why they downvoted, but sometimes they might not. If they left a reason, it is up to you to determine if you did anything wrong, and if there is anything you want to change.

# Reputation

## <span id="What_is_Reputation">What is Reputation?</span>

Every user has a reputation score next to their name. The reputation score is one way Steemit measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. It is also a mechanism that is designed to help reduce abuse of the Steemit platform.

Your reputation goes up when accounts vote on your content. Getting downvoted by someone with a higher reputation can push your reputation down and make your posts less visible.

Users with a lower reputation score are unable to affect your reputation.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_the_Reputation_score_measured">How is the Reputation score measured?</span>

Every new user starts off with a reputation score of 25.

The reputation score is based off of a `log10` system, which means that a score of 40 is about 10x better than a score of 30.

More information about the calculation of the reputation score can be found in this post from @digitalnotvir:

## <span id="How_do_I_improve_my_reputation_score">How do I improve my reputation score?</span>

Every time another user upvotes one of your posts or comments, it increases your reputation score. The more Steem Power that the voter has, the larger the effect is. The best way to earn upvotes is by adding value to the Steemit community.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="What_causes_my_reputation_score_to_go_down">What causes my reputation score to go down?</span>

The only way for your reputation score to go down is to be downvoted by another user. Not all downvotes will cause a reputation loss though.

- Downvotes from users with a lower reputation score than you will not hurt your score.
- If your post or comment that was downvoted still received more upvotes than downvotes (weighted by SP), then the net effect on your reputation score will still be positive.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
## <span id="Why_does_my_reputation_score_matter">Why does my reputation score matter?</span>

A reputation score is one way Steemit measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. In real estate, they say there are three variables of the utmost importance: location, location, location. On Steemit, those things are: reputation, reputation, reputation. It’s not to say other variables aren’t important, but reputation will be an enormous factor in your level of success.

Many Steemians glance at users’ reputation scores when deciding which articles to read because they know higher reputation scores means it is much more likely quality content. Furthermore, the higher your rep, the more effect your vote will have on the reputation of others.

It is worth noting that if your reputation score goes below 0, Steemit will hide your posts and comments making it very difficult to gain monetary rewards and followers. This incentivizes online etiquette and respect for your fellow Steemians.

This is like reblogging or sharing posts on other platforms.  Once you resteem a post it will appear in your feed and in your followers' feeds as if you had posted it yourself.  Use it conservatively and with caution.  It is great to want to share content you like and appreciate with people you follow, but you don't want to overwhelm your followers either.

# Blockchain

## <span id="What_is_a_blockchain">What is a blockchain?</span>

A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions ever executed. All of the transactions and data are stored in a distributed database. Each time the database is updated, all of updates are done together in a batch called a 'block'. Each time a new block is produced/added, it is appended on to all of the previous blocks - hence the name "blockchain".

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="What_is_the_Steem_blockchain">What is the Steem blockchain?</span>

The Steem blockchain is the publicly accessible distributed database, which records all posts and votes, and distributes the rewards across the network. It is where all of the text content and voting data is stored, and it is where all of the reward calculations and payouts are performed.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_bandwidth_work_on_the_Steem_blockchain">How does bandwidth work on the Steem blockchain?</span>

Since transacting on the Steem blockchain has zero fees, bandwidth rate-limiting is employed to safeguard the blockchain from spam attacks. Everything action that you take on the blockchain will consume a small amount of bandwidth. This includes posting, commenting, voting, transferring tokens, etc. Viewing content does not consume bandwidth.

Every user has a limited amount of bandwidth to use each week. The more transactions a user does, the less bandwidth they will have left (until it recharges). Users with more Steem Power will have a higher bandwidth allowance.

Normally everyone's bandwidth allowance is quite high, and users are able to use the network freely without any interruptions. Sometimes when the blockchain becomes busy however (due to heavy use), everyone's individual allowances may go down until the network becomes less busy.

You can check how much bandwidth you currently have based on the current limit at:
https://steemd.com/@youraccount

If users are below their bandwidth limit, they will be unable to transact with the blockchain until their bandwidth recharges or their limit is raised.

If you get an error that you have exceeded your bandwidth allowance, it is normally best to just wait and try again later (when it is less busy). Usually if you wait and try again later, the transaction will likley go through.

If you are unable to transact for extended periods of time, or you are frequently running into bandwidth limits, then you will either need to reduce your usage to stay within your limit, or purchase more Steem Power for your account through a third-party exchange such as [BlockTrades](https://blocktrades.us/?input_coin_type=eth&output_coin_type=steem_power&receive_address=).

## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_Steem_and_Steemit">What is the difference between Steem and Steemit?</span>

Steem is the name of the blockchain that stores all of the data and transactions, and processes all of the events that take place. STEEM is also a name for the system’s value token (currency).

Steemit is a front end web interface to interact with the blockchain, and view the blockchain data. Steemit, Inc. is also the name of the company that owns and operates the website steemit.com.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_is_Steem_different_from_Bitcoin">How is Steem different from Bitcoin?</span>

On a technical level, the two networks rely on the same model of a blockchain, but are built upon different technologies and codebase. Steem is based on a new state-of-the-art blockchain technology called Graphene, which uses "witnesses" instead of "miners" to produce blocks.

The "delegated proof of stake" model of using witnesses instead of miners allows for greater efficiency in block production. With BTC, 100% of the new coins that are created are allocated to block producers (miners). With the Steem blockchain, only 10% of the new coins are paid to block producers (witnesses). The other 90% of new STEEM coins are awarded to content producers, curators, and Steem Power holders.

## <span id="What_is_the_difference_between_Proof_of_Work__Proof_of_Stake__and_Delegated_Proof_of_Stake">What is the difference between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake?</span>

**Proof of work** - Miners solve a complex mathematical problem. The miner that solves the problem first adds the block to the blockchain. The network rewards the miner for doing so.

**Proof of stake** - Requires ownership, or stake, in the cryptocurrency. The more tokens you own, the more block creation power you have. Benefits: eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs, runs on a tiny fraction of the power, and it requires block producers to have a stake in the network.

**Delegated proof of stake** - Block-creating accounts, called witnesses, are collectively approved by Steem stakeholders. Instead of relying on proof of work to find blocks, the Steem network actively schedules these accounts to improve the time between blocks to 3 seconds.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Blockchain">^</a>
## <span id="How_often_does_the_Steem_blockchain_produce_a_new_block">How often does the Steem blockchain produce a new block?</span>

The Steem blockchain schedules witnesses to produce a new block every 3 seconds. 21 witness nodes produce 21 blocks in each 63-second round.

## <span id="Is_there_a_way_to_see_the_raw_data_that_is_stored_in_the_blockchain">Is there a way to see the raw data that is stored in the blockchain?</span>

## <span id="Where_can_I_find_the_information_for_the_official_launch_of_the_blockchain">Where can I find the information for the official launch of the blockchain?</span>

The original launch of Steem was on March 23, 2016, announced on <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1408726.0">Bitcointalk.org</a>. There was a bug found in the original code though, and a majority of the stakeholders agreed that it would be easier to fix via a re-launch than a hardfork. The blockchain was reset and officially re-launched on March 24, 2016, via <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1410943.0">Bitcointalk.org</a>.

# Security

## <span id="How_can_I_keep_my_Steem_account_secure">How can I keep my Steem account secure?</span>

<b>Save your master password and keep it somewhere safe.</b>

Only log into your account using the key with the appropriate permissions for what you are doing:
- Posting key for every day logins
- Active key when necessary for transfers, power ups, etc.
- Master password or owner key when changing the password

Again, <b>save your master password</b> and keep it safe! If logging in with your post key, make sure you don't overwrite or misplace your original master password.

It is not recommended to share your password or keys with any third party site. Steemit Inc. is developing a login application that can be used on third party Steem front ends.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="Why_should_I_be_careful_with_my_master_password">Why should I be careful with my master password?</span>

The master password is used to derive all keys for your account, including the owner key. If someone has access to your master password, they can steal your account and all of the tokens in it.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="Why_is_the_master_password_a_long_string_of_gibberish">Why is the master password a long string of gibberish?</span>

The password has to be long and random for maximum account security.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="What_are_my_different_keys_for">What are my different keys for?</span>

**Posting key** - The posting key allows accounts to post, comment, edit, vote, resteem, and follow or mute other accounts. Most users should be logging into Steemit every day with the posting key. You are more likely to have your password or key compromised the more you use it so a limited posting key exists to restrict the damage that a compromised account key would cause.

**Active key** - The active key is meant for more sensitive tasks such as transferring funds, power up/down transactions, converting Steem Dollars, voting for witnesses, updating profile details and avatar, and placing a market order.

**Memo key** - Currently the memo key is not used.

**Owner key** - The owner key is only meant for use when necessary. It is the most powerful key because it can change any key of an account, including the owner key. Ideally it is meant to be stored offline, and only used to recover a compromised account.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="What_do_I_do_if_I_lost_my_password_keys">What do I do if I lost my password/keys?</span>

There is no way to recover your account if you lose your password or owner key! Because your account has real value, it is **very important** that you save your master password somewhere safe where you will not lose it.

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

No, liquid tokens can not be taken back if stolen or sent to the wrong account. If your tokens are in Steem Power, it is impossible for a hacker to take out more than 1/13 per week. If your tokens are in savings, there is a three-day wait period for them to become transferable.

## <span id="What_should_I_do_if_I_discover_that_someone_hacked_my_account">What should I do if I discover that someone hacked my account?</span>

If you made your account through Steemit and it is compromised, immediately visit the <a href="https://steemit.com/recover_account_step_1">Stolen Account Recovery</a> page. This link is also available in the main site menu. You will need to provide the email address that you used when you signed up, your account name, and a master password that was used in the last 30 days.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
## <span id="How_does_the_stolen_account_recovery_process_work">How does the stolen account recovery process work?</span>

If your password has been changed without your consent, then the account designated as your recovery account can generate a new owner key for the account. The account recovery must be completed within 30 days of the password being changed, and you must supply a recent owner key that was valid within the last 30 days.

Steemit Inc. owns the default recovery account (@steem) for all users who sign up using steemit.com. Steemit can only identify users by their original email, Facebook, or Reddit logins that were used to signup via steemit.com.

If you don't have the master password or owner key that was valid the past 30 days, or are unable to prove that you are the original owner of the account, then your account will be unrecoverable.

# Witnesses

## <span id="What_are_Steem_witnesses">What are Steem witnesses?</span>

The Steem blockchain requires a set of people to create blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called delegated proof of stake, or DPOS. The community elects 'witnesses' to act as the network's block producers and governance body. There are 20 full-time witnesses, producing a block every 63-second round. A 21st position is shared by the backup witnesses, who are scheduled proportionally to the amount of stake-weighted community approval they have. Witnesses are compensated with Steem Power for each block they create.

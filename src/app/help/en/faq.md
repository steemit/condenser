# General

<a class="anchor" name="What_is_Steemit_com"></a>
## What is Steemit.com?

Steemit is a social network and content rewards platform that makes the crowd the beneficiaries of the attention economy. It does this be rewarding users with STEEM.

Steemit has redefined social media by building a living, breathing, and growing social economy; a community where users are getting rewarded for sharing their voice.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="How_does_Steemit_work"></a>
## How does Steemit work?

Steemit is a social media platform that works by having the crowd reward the crowd for their content. It does this thanks to the Steem blockchain and cryptocurrency; Steem is 'minted' daily and distributed to content producers according to the votes they get.

<a class="anchor" name="How_does_Steemit_differ_from_other_social_media_websites"></a>
## How does Steemit differ from other social media websites?

Most social media sites extract value from their userbase for the benefit of shareholders alone. Steemit is different, it's a new kind of attention economy. By connecting with the Steem blockchain (which is decentralized and controlled by the crowd), Steemit users receive all the benefits and rewards for their attention.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Does_it_cost_anything_to_post__comment__or_vote"></a>
## Does it cost anything to post, comment, or vote?

No. It is free to post, comment, and vote on content on Steemit.com. You might even get paid for it!

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Can_I_earn_digital_tokens_on_Steemit_How"></a>
## Can I earn digital tokens on Steemit? How?

You can earn digital tokens on Steemit by:

**Posting** - By sharing your posts, you can earn upvotes from community members. Depending on the upvotes you receive, you will get a portion of the ongoing Steem reward pool.

**Voting and curating** - If you discover a post and upvote it before it becomes popular, you can earn a curation reward. The reward amount will depend on the amount of STEEM Power you have.

**Purchasing** - Users can purchase STEEM or Steem Dollar tokens directly through the Steemit wallet using bitcoin, Ether, or BitShares tokens. They are also available from other markets and exchanges including BlockTrades, Poloniex, Bittrex, Shapeshift.io, and Changelly. STEEM tokens that are powered up to STEEM Power earn a small amount of interest for holding.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Where_do_the_tokens_come_from"></a>
## Where do the tokens come from?

The Steem network continually creates digital tokens to reward content creators and curators. Some of the newly-created tokens are transferred to users who add value to Steemit by posting, commenting, and voting on other people's posts. The remainder is distributed to holders of STEEM Power and the witnesses that power the blockchain.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Where_does_the_value_come_from"></a>
## Where does the value come from?

At its root, Steem is simply a points system. However, because this points system is blockchain-based, the points can be traded on markets as tokens. People buy and sell these tokens, and many hold in anticipation of increased purchasing power for various Steem-related services.

By analogy, Steem is a game system where users compete for attention and rewards by bringing content and adding value to the platform. The rewards people earn are tokens that have market value and are readily tradable. It is similar to how someone playing a video game could obtain a limited item or currency by playing the game. If the currency or items are transferable between users, then they can sell or buy them on game item markets.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_General">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Why_are_people_getting_vastly_different_rewards"></a>
## Why are people getting vastly different rewards?

Steemit is not a "get rich quick" scheme. While it is possible to post content that goes viral quickly and earn a lot of rewards on a single post, this is not typical for most users.

Most of the authors that you see earning high rewards are users that have spent a lot of time in the network building followings, making connections with others, and developing a reputation for bringing high quality content.

It is best to have realistic expectations, without focusing on rewards when you are first starting out. Work on building a following, making connections, and developing a good reputation. Consistency will pay off in the long run.

## How long does the account approval process take?

Most accounts are approved within 24 hours. Some may take up to a week.

<a class="anchor" name="Why_do_I_need_to_provide_my_email_and_phone_number"></a>
## Why do I need to provide my email and phone number?

To create an account on the blockchain, it costs STEEM tokens. When you create an account through Steemit.com, Steemit Inc. is supplying the tokens to pay the account creation fee. In order to prevent users from abusing the paid-for signup and creating multiple accounts, we need to be able to verify that each user is only signing up for one account.

## Can I create a Steem account without an email and phone number?

The only way to have an account created via Steemit.com is to supply your email and phone number. Because Steem is an open and permissionless network, there are other ways to create a Steem account. Any Steem blockchain account can be used on Steemit.com

<a class="anchor" name="What_are_other_ways_to_create_an_account_on_the_blockchain_besides_using_Steemit_com"></a>
## What are other ways to create an account on the blockchain besides using Steemit.com?

If you are willing to pay your own signup fee, then there are other ways to create a new account on the blockchain.

There is a third-party tool called <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@someguy123/anonsteem-create-anonymous-steem-accounts-without-social-media">AnonSteem</a> that accepts bitcoin, Litecoin, STEEM, or SBD to anonymously create a Steem account. You do not need to have an existing Steem blockchain account to use the service, but there is a charge on top of the blockchain account creation fee for using the service.

There is also a third-party tool called <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@timcliff/new-tool-from-busy-org-create-new-steem-blockchain-accounts-with-steemconnect">SteemConnect</a> that allows you to create accounts by paying or delegating the account creation fee. There is no additional fee to use the service, but does require an existing Steem blockchain account to pay the account creation fee to create the account.

<a class="anchor" name="Am_I_required_to_verify_my_identity"></a>
## Am I required to verify my identity?

Verification is a process where users give evidence to show that they are the person that they claim to be.  This is to reduce fraud and people impersonating known figures. If you would like to remain anonymous, that is perfectly fine. However if you claim to be someone specific, the community may expect that you verify you are who you say you are.

There are a number of ways to do this. The most common way to verify your identity is by posting a link to your Steemit profile on a website or social media account which you are already known for having such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, a blog, or photography site.

Many users also like to post a photo or a video which shows them holding up a sheet of paper with the current date and their Steem account name handwritten on it. This is a great way to add a personal touch to verifying.

Tags are a way to categorize your content, so that others can find it. The more relevant the tags are to the post, the more like-minded people will come across it.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Posting">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="What_tags_should_I_use"></a>
## What tags should I use?

Try to use tags that are relevant to your post, and that will be popular for other people to browse. For example, "mytriptoalaska" may be relevant to your post, but readers are probably not going to go searching for that. Using "travel" would be a better choice for a tag in this case.

You can browse through commonly used tags using the "Explore" link, in the main menu.

Be mindful when choosing tags. If your tags aren’t related to your post, your post may get downvotes for mistagging.

All tags must be lowercase letters. Spaces aren't allowed, but hyphenated words with a single dash are.

## What does "Promoting" a post do?

When you make a post, there is the option to promote it with Steem Dollars. It will then show up in the “Promoted” tab. The order that it appears in the list depends on how much the post was promoted for. Posts with a higher promoted amount will be higher than posts with less.

Steem Dollars spent to promote a post are paid to the account @null, which nobody owns or controls. Once a user transfers SBD to @null, the Steem blockchain removes them from the currency supply. Details can be found in this <a href="https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitblog/introducing-promoted-content">official post</a>.

You can promote your own posts, or posts that you like from other users.

# Economics

<a class="anchor" name="Where_do_the_new_STEEM_tokens_come_from"></a>
## Where do the new STEEM tokens come from?

Blockchains like Steem and Bitcoin produce new tokens each time a block is produced. Unlike Bitcoin, where all of the new coins go to the block producers (called miners), the Steem blockchain allocates a majority of the new tokens to a reward fund. The reward fund gives users tokens for participating in the platform.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="How_many_new_tokens_are_generated_by_the_blockchain"></a>
## How many new tokens are generated by the blockchain?

Starting with the network's 16th hard fork in December 2016, Steem began creating new tokens at a yearly inflation rate of 9.5%. The inflation rate decreases at a rate of 0.01% every 250,000 blocks, or about 0.5% per year. The inflation will continue decreasing at this pace until the overall inflation rate reaches 0.95%. This will take about 20.5 years from the time hard fork 16 went into effect.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="How_are_the_new_tokens_distributed"></a>
## How are the new tokens distributed?

Out of the new tokens that are generated:
- 75% go to the reward pool, which is split between authors and curators. 
- 15% of the new tokens are awarded to holders of STEEM Power. 
- The remaining 10% pays for the witnesses to power the blockchain.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="What_is_the_reward_pool"></a>
## What is the reward pool?

Every day, a fixed amount of STEEM tokens are allocated to the network reward fund, commonly called the "reward pool." These get distributed to authors and curators for posting and voting on content.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="How_is_the_reward_pool_split_between_authors_and_curators"></a>
## How is the reward pool split between authors and curators?

Up to 25% of a post's payout is awarded to curators (the people who upvoted the post) as a reward for discovering the content. The other 75% is awarded to the author. If curators vote for a post within the first 30 minutes of it being created, a portion of their curation reward is added to the author payout. This portion is linear to the age of the post between 0 and 30 minutes. Therefore upvoting at 15 minutes old will donate half of your potential curation reward to the author.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Will_the_reward_pool_pay_out_more_or_less_depending_on_who_votes"></a>
## Will the reward pool pay out more or less depending on who votes?

There is a fixed amount of STEEM coins that gets added to the rewards pool each day. In the short term, the amount of coins that get paid out may be higher or lower depending on the amount of voting activity, but over time it will pay out the full amount of rewards regardless of who votes.

Votes in Steem are stake-weighted. Therefore voters with more STEEM Power have a greater influence over the allocation than voters with less SP, but their votes do not increase the amount of rewards.

<a class="anchor" name="Why_do_the_earnings_for_my_post_go_up_or_down"></a>
## Why do the earnings for my post go up or down?

The amount that is shown next to a post is a "**Potential Payout**". This is an estimated value of how much money the post will make based on the votes that have occurred so far. Depending on various factors, this value can go up or down until the payout window closes:

- If a post receives more upvotes, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If a post receives more downvotes, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If other posts receive more upvotes, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If other posts receive more downvotes, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If upvotes are removed from a post, the potential payout of the post can go down.
- If downvotes are removed from a post, the potential payout of the post can go up.
- If the price of STEEM goes up, the potential payout of all posts can go up.
- If the price of STEEM goes down, the potential payout of all posts can go down.

<a class="anchor" name="What_is_the_difference_between_STEEM__STEEM_Power__and_Steem_Dollars"></a>
## What is the difference between STEEM, STEEM Power, and Steem Dollars?

**STEEM** - STEEM is the base liquid currency token in the platform. STEEM can be powered up into STEEM Power, traded for Steem Dollars, and transferred to other accounts. It is a cryptocurrency token, similar to bitcoin.

**STEEM Power** - STEEM Power (abbreviated SP) is a measurement of how much influence a user has in the Steem network. The more STEEM Power a user holds, the more they can influence the value of posts and comments. STEEM Power is less liquid. If a user wishes to “Power Down” SP, they will receive equal distributions of the STEEM weekly, over a 13 week period.

**Steem Dollars** - Steem Dollars (commonly abbreviated SBD) are liquid stable-value currency tokens designed to be pegged to $1 USD. Steem Dollars can be traded with STEEM, and transferred to other accounts for commerce or exchange.  Steem Dollars may also be converted into STEEM in a process that takes 3.5 days. Steem Dollars can be used to buy things in marketplaces, such as PeerHub.com.

<a class="anchor" name="What_is_delegated_STEEM_Power"></a>
## What is delegated STEEM Power?

Users have the option to delegate STEEM Power to other users. When a user is delegated STEEM Power, their content votes and curation rewards are calculated as if it were their own STEEM Power. Users are not able to power down or cash out delegated STEEM Power, as it still belongs to the original owner.

Most users will have a small amount of STEEM Power delegated to them by the Steemit account after creating an account via Steemit.com.

Delegated STEEM Power shows up in a user's wallet below their actual STEEM Power balance in parentheses.

<a class="anchor" name="How_do_I_get_more_STEEM_Power"></a>
## How do I get more STEEM Power?

With STEEM tokens in your wallet, click "Power Up" to turn them into STEEM Power. If you have Steem Dollars, you can convert them to STEEM from your wallet, and then power up the STEEM.

If you don’t already have STEEM or Steem Dollars in your wallet, you can purchase them using bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or BitShares (BTS) tokens. You may purchase BTC on various exchanges, such as Coinbase.com or Localbitcoins.com. 

To buy:
- Click "Buy Steem" from the main menu in the top right corner of Steemit.com, or from your wallet.
- Select the currency to deposit, and enter the amount of that currency you wish to use.
- Enter your Steemit account name (without the @) for "Your receive address".
- Click the "Get Deposit Address" button.
- Send the currency to the provided address.

STEEM purchases made via Steemit.com are facilitated by <a href="https://blocktrades.us">BlockTrades</a>.

bitcoin can also be exchanged for STEEM on external markets such as <a href="https://poloniex.com">Poloniex</a>, <a href="https://bittrex.com">Bittrex</a>, <a href="https://shapeshift.io">ShapeShift.io</a>, and <a href="https://changelly.com">Changelly</a>.

## How long does it take STEEM or STEEM Power that I purchased to show up in my account?

Transactions on the Steem blockchain typically only take about three seconds to process, but when you are purchasing the STEEM tokens using bitcoin or some other token, then the transaction must wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the other network. This can often take several hours, and sometimes even days.    

If you paid using bitcoin, the third party website <a href="https://bitcoinfees.21.co/">bitcoinfees.21.co</a> can estimate the approximate wait time of the transaction based on the fees that were paid. The third party website <a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain.info</a> will lookup the fees that were paid on a specific blockchain transaction.

<a class="anchor" name="What_is_powering_up_and_down"></a>
## What is powering up and down?

**Powering up** - If you have STEEM tokens, you can Power Up to STEEM Power to get more voting influence on posts and comments. Having more STEEM Power also increases the amount of curation rewards and interest that you can earn. More SP also grants more influence on approving Steem witnesses.

**Powering down** - If you have STEEM Power, you can power down to turn it into liquid STEEM over a period of time. The system will transfer 1/13 of your STEEM Power to STEEM each week for about three months (13 weeks), starting 1 week from the time it is started. However, you will lose your influence in the network proportionally to how much is powered down, so think about it carefully. Power downs can be stopped at any time.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="What_do_the_dollar_amounts_for_pending_payouts_represent"></a>
## What do the dollar amounts for pending payouts represent?

The dollar amounts next to posts and comments are estimates of the potential payout that will occur when the payout period ends, based on the current voting activity and price of STEEM. These potential payout amounts may fluctuate up or down until the payout period ends.

Payouts occur as a combination of STEEM Power and Steem Dollars. Sometimes the blockchain may substitute STEEM in place of the Steem Dollars based on market conditions.

The blockchain estimates the dollar value of STEEM and STEEM Power based on the 3.5 day average price of STEEM reported by the witnesses. The blockchain assumes Steem Dollars are worth approximately one USD.

<a class="anchor" name="Will_1_Steem_Dollar_always_be_worth__1_00_USD"></a>
## Will 1 Steem Dollar always be worth $1.00 USD?

The market value of a Steem Dollar is dictated by the supply and demand of the token. Therefore it is possible for 1 SBD to be worth more or less than 1 USD depending on market conditions. However, the network's SBD conversion feature serves as a mechanism to hold Steem Dollars within a small margin of the value of USD.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Economics">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="How_do_Steem_Dollar_to_STEEM_conversions_work"></a>
## How do Steem Dollar to STEEM conversions work?

If you convert Steem Dollars to STEEM on the Wallet page, the blockchain will process the transaction over a period of 3.5 days. At the end of the 3.5 days, the SBD will be gone and replaced by approximately $1 USD worth of STEEM tokens. The "approximately 1 USD worth of STEEM tokens" is based on the median STEEM price over the 3.5 days, using the price feeds from the Steem witnesses. Depending on price fluctuations during the 3.5 days it is possible to end up with more or less than $1 USD worth of STEEM per SBD at the end of the conversion.

You can exchange them. Visit the internal Market, found in the main menu. There you can exchange your SBD for STEEM in real-time at whatever the current market price is.

Depending on market conditions, users may get more STEEM for their SBD by trading them for STEEM on the internal market, rather than using the conversion.

# Voting and Curating

<a class="anchor" name="What_is_my_voting_power"></a>
## What is my voting power?

Voting power is like an "energy bar" in a computer game that goes down a little bit every time you vote. You start out with 100% voting power. Every time you vote, you will use a small amount of your voting power.

As you use more of your voting power, your votes will carry less influence. A vote with 50% voting power left will be worth 1/2 as much as a vote cast with 100% voting power. Not to worry, the network recharges your voting power by 20% every day.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="How_many_times_can_I_vote_without_depleting_my_voting_power"></a>
## How many times can I vote without depleting my voting power?

Every 100% vote you cast will use 2% of your remaining voting power. Your voting power will recharge by 20% each day. You can vote more than 10 times per day, but each vote will be worth less, and it will take longer to reach full voting power again.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Voting_and_Curating">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Can_I_vote_with_less_than_100__of_my_voting_strength"></a>
## Can I vote with less than 100% of my voting strength?

New users can only upvote and downvote with 100% voting strength. 

Once you reach about 500 STEEM Power, you will see a vote slider appear when you vote. You can use the slider to adjust the weight of your vote, between 1% and 100% voting strength. Voting with less than 100% voting weight will use up less voting power, but it will also have less of an influence on the post or comment's rewards.

<img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmV6c21tzSrgXwPHx4tvuc1UiCXBEvzkLBH9QCZHtVN6Ma/image.png">

Upvotes and downvotes use the same amount of voting power.

<a class="anchor" name="What_determines_how_much_of_the_curation_reward_goes_to_the_author_versus_curators"></a>
## What determines how much of the curation reward goes to the author versus curators?

The rewards are allocated so that 75% of the payout goes to the author of the post/comment, and 25% goes to the curator. 

Of the 25% that goes to the curator, that portion will be split between the author and the curator if the curator votes within the first 30 minutes. The split of the 25% between the author and curator during the first 30 minutes is calculated linearly based on the time the vote is cast.

- If a post is upvoted the moment of posting, 100% of the curation reward goes to the author.
- At 3 minutes, 90% goes to the author and 10% to the curator.
- At 15 minutes it's a 50/50 split.
- At 27 minutes, 10% goes to the author and 90% to the curator.
- If a post is upvoted 30 min after posting, 100% of the curation reward goes to the curator.

<a class="anchor" name="What_are_curation_trails"></a>
## What are curation trails?

Some users decide to use third party applications such as <a href="https://streemian.com/">Streemian</a> to automatically cast votes. Users can automatically vote for the same posts and comments that other users does. Typically they will set this up to follow the votes of users who are good at curating. When a user has other users automatically voting for the same content that they do, the people that automatically vote after them are called their "curation trail".

<a class="anchor" name="Why_don_t_my_upvotes_have_an_effect_on_a_post_s_rewards"></a>
## Why don't my upvotes have an effect on a post's rewards?

A user with more SP is going to have a larger influence on the rewards than users with less SP. One vote from a user with a lot of SP can often have more of an effect than 100 votes from users with a small amount of SP.

Even though your vote may not have an immediate effect, when it gets added in along with all the other votes at the end of the payout period, it can still affect the payout. It may also cause more users to vote on the post too, because they saw that you upvoted it - so your votes can have an indirect effect on the payout this way.

Yes. The more STEEM Power you have, the more influence your votes will have.

The platform does not require that anybody purchase SP in order to participate, and there are many users who have earned a lot of STEEM Power without spending any of their own money. You have the option of purchasing more STEEM Power through your Steemit wallet.

Just because you received a downvote does not mean that you did something wrong.

Often users will leave a comment explaining why they downvoted, but sometimes they might not. If they left a reason, it is up to you to determine if you did anything wrong, and if there is anything you want to change.

# Reputation

<a class="anchor" name="What_is_Reputation"></a>
## What is Reputation?

Every user has a reputation score next to their name. The reputation score is one way Steemit measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. It is also a mechanism that is designed to help reduce abuse of the Steemit platform. 

Your reputation goes up when accounts vote on your content. Getting downvoted by someone with a higher reputation can push your reputation down and make your posts less visible.

Users with a lower reputation score are unable to affect your reputation.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="How_is_the_Reputation_score_measured"></a>
## How is the Reputation score measured?

Every new user starts off with a reputation score of 25.

The reputation score is based off of a `log10` system, which means that a score of 40 is about 10x better than a score of 30.

More information about the calculation of the reputation score can be found in this post from @digitalnotvir:

## How do I improve my reputation score?

Every time another user upvotes one of your posts or comments, it increases your reputation score. Users with a higher reputation than you will have more of a positive effect. The more STEEM Power that the voter has, the larger the effect is as well. The best way to earn upvotes is by adding value to the Steemit community.

<a class="anchor" name="What_causes_my_reputation_score_to_go_down"></a>
## What causes my reputation score to go down?

The only way for your reputation score to go down is to be downvoted by another user. Not all downvotes will cause a reputation loss though.

- Downvotes from users with a lower reputation score than you will not hurt your score. 
- If your post or comment that was downvoted still received more upvotes than downvotes (weighted by SP), then the net effect on your reputation score will still be positive.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Reputation">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="Why_does_my_reputation_score_matter"></a>
## Why does my reputation score matter?

A reputation score is one way Steemit measures the amount of value you have brought to the community. In real estate, they say there are three variables of the utmost importance: location, location, location. On Steemit, those things are: reputation, reputation, reputation. It’s not to say other variables aren’t important, but reputation will be an enormous factor in your level of success.

Many Steemians glance at users’ reputation scores when deciding which articles to read because they know higher reputation scores means it is much more likely quality content. Furthermore, the higher your rep, the more effect your vote will have on the reputation of others.

It is worth noting that if your reputation score goes below 0, Steemit will hide your posts and comments making it very difficult to gain monetary rewards and followers. This incentivizes online etiquette and respect for your fellow Steemians.

The Steem blockchain is the publicly accessible distributed database, which records all posts and votes, and distributes the rewards across the network. It is where all of the text content and voting data is stored, and it is where all of the reward calculations and payouts are performed.

## What is the difference between Steem and Steemit?

Steem is the name of the blockchain that stores all of the data and transactions, and processes all of the events that take place. STEEM is also a name for the system’s value token (currency).

Steemit is a front end web interface to interact with the blockchain, and view the blockchain data.

<a class="anchor" name="How_is_Steem_different_from_Bitcoin"></a>
## How is Steem different from Bitcoin?

On a technical level, the two networks rely on the same model of a blockchain, but are built upon different technologies and codebase. Steem is based on a new state-of-the-art blockchain technology called Graphene, which uses "witnesses" instead of "miners" to produce blocks. 

The "delegated proof of stake" model of using witnesses instead of miners allows for greater efficiency in block production. With BTC, 100% of the new coins that are created are allocated to block producers (miners). With the Steem blockchain, only 10% of the new coins are paid to block producers (witnesses). The other 90% of new STEEM coins are awarded to content producers, curators, and STEEM Power holders.

<a class="anchor" name="What_is_the_difference_between_Proof_of_Work__Proof_of_Stake__and_Delegated_Proof_of_Stake"></a>
## What is the difference between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake?

**Proof of work** - Miners solve a complex mathematical problem. The miner that solves the problem first adds the block to the blockchain. The network rewards the miner for doing so.

**Proof of stake** - Requires ownership, or stake, in the cryptocurrency. The more tokens you own, the more block creation power you have. Benefits: eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs, runs on a tiny fraction of the power, and it requires block producers to have a stake in the network.

**Delegated proof of stake** - Block-creating accounts, called witnesses, are collectively approved by Steem stakeholders. Instead of relying on proof of work to find blocks, the Steem network actively schedules these accounts to improve the time between blocks to 3 seconds.

<a class="anchor" name="How_often_does_the_Steem_blockchain_produce_a_new_block"></a>
## How often does the Steem blockchain produce a new block?

The Steem blockchain schedules witnesses to produce a new block every 3 seconds. 21 witness nodes produce 21 blocks in each 63-second round.

## Where can I find the information for the official launch of the blockchain?

The original launch of Steem was on March 23, 2016, announced on <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1408726.0">Bitcointalk.org</a>. There was a bug found in the original code though, and a majority of the stakeholders agreed that it would be easier to fix via a re-launch than a hardfork. The blockchain was reset and officially re-launched on March 24, 2016, via <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1410943.0">Bitcointalk.org</a>.

# Security

<a class="anchor" name="How_can_I_keep_my_Steem_account_secure"></a>
## How can I keep my Steem account secure?

<b>Save your master password and keep it somewhere safe.</b>

Only log into your account using the key with the appropriate permissions for what you are doing:
- Posting key for every day logins
- Active key when necessary for transfers, power ups, etc.
- Master password or owner key when changing the password

Again, <b>save your master password</b> and keep it safe! If logging in with your post key, make sure you don't overwrite or misplace your original master password.

It is not recommended to share your password or keys with any third party site. Steemit Inc. is developing a login application that can be used on third party Steem front ends.

<a class="anchor" name="Why_should_I_be_careful_with_my_master_password"></a>
## Why should I be careful with my master password?

The master password is used to derive all keys for your account, including the owner key.

<a class="anchor" name="Why_is_the_master_password_a_long_string_of_gibberish"></a>
## Why is the master password a long string of gibberish?

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="What_are_my_different_keys_for"></a>
## What are my different keys for?

**Posting key** - The posting key allows accounts to post, comment, edit, vote, resteem, and follow or mute other accounts. Most users should be logging into Steemit every day with the posting key. You are more likely to have your password or key compromised the more you use it so a limited posting key exists to restrict the damage that a compromised account key would cause.

**Active key** - The active key is meant for more sensitive tasks such as transferring funds, power up/down transactions, converting Steem Dollars, voting for witnesses, updating profile details and avatar, and placing a market order. 

**Memo key** - Currently the memo key is not used.

**Owner key** - The owner key is only meant for use when necessary. It is the most powerful key because it can change any key of an account, including the owner key. Ideally it is meant to be stored offline, and only used to recover a compromised account.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="What_do_I_do_if_I_lost_my_password_keys"></a>
## What do I do if I lost my password/keys?

There is no way to recover your account if you lose your password or owner key! Because your account has real value, it is **very important** that you save your master password somewhere safe where you will not lose it.

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage, such as an external disk or flash drive, as well as printed paper. Use a safe deposit box for best redundancy.

## Are my STEEM and Steem Dollar tokens insured in the event of a hack or if someone takes over my account?

No, liquid tokens can not be taken back if stolen or sent to the wrong account. If your tokens are in STEEM Power, it is impossible for a hacker to take out more than 1/13 per week. If your tokens are in savings, there is a three-day wait period for them to become transferable.

## What should I do if I discover that someone hacked my account?

If you made your account through Steemit and it is compromised, immediately visit the <a href="https://steemit.com/recover_account_step_1">Stolen Account Recovery</a> page. This link is also available in the main site menu. You will need to provide your account name and a master password that was used in the last 30 days.

<a href="/faq.html#Table_of_Contents_Security">^</a>
<a class="anchor" name="How_does_the_recovery_process_work"></a>
## How does the recovery process work?

In Steem, to be able to recover a compromised account, each account has another account assigned as its designated recovery agent. This is someone who can identify you independently of your key.

Steemit Inc. owns the default recovery account (@steem) for all users who sign up using Steemit.com. Steemit can identify users by their email, Facebook, and Reddit logins if you made an account using Steemit.com.

Advanced users using the blockchain software can recover accounts that have different recovery accounts assigned. If your password has been changed without your consent, then the account designated as your recovery account can generate a new owner key after you've supplied a recent owner key (valid in the last 30 days) for the account.

If you don't have the master password or owner key that was valid the past 30 days, then your account will be unrecoverable.

# Witnesses

<a class="anchor" name="What_are_Steem_witnesses"></a>
## What are Steem witnesses?

The Steem blockchain requires a set of people to create blocks and uses a consensus mechanism called delegated proof of stake, or DPOS. The community elects 'witnesses' to act as the network's block producers and governance body. There are 20 full-time witnesses, producing a block every 63-second round. A 21st position is shared by backup witnesses, who are scheduled proportionally to the amount of stake-weighted community approval they have. Witnesses are compensated with STEEM Power for each block they create.

Steemit leverages Steem because the founders of Steemit believe Steem’s decentralized text content storage and governance model makes Steem an excellent platform for supporting the long term success of its social network and digital currency tokens.

## What is the Steem Whitepaper and what is its purpose?

The Steem Whitepaper was written to describe the mechanics of the token system that makes decentralized content incentives and distribution possible in a way that can improve web technologies across the board. It is also applicable to Steemit, the first website to plug into the Steem blockchain. Users who have read the Steem Whitepaper will better understand how their interactions with Steemit are interactions with Steem, the decentralized network.

It is worth noting that the Whitepaper hasn’t been updated almost since Steem came into existence. Many changes have been made since then, so much of the Whitepaper is now out of date. It is in the process of being rewritten.

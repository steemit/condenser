understand that your use of Third-Party Content, and your interactions with
third parties, is at your own risk.

## 9. Account Registration

9.1. You need not use a Steemit Account. If you wish to use an Account, you
must create a Steem Blockchain account to access the Services (“Account”). When
you create an Account, you are strongly advised to take the following
precautions, as failure to do so may result in loss of access to, and/or
control over, your Account: (a) Create a strong password that you do not use
for any other website or online service; (b) Provide accurate and truthful
information; (c) Maintain and promptly update your Account information; (d)
maintain the security of your Account by protecting your Account password and
access to your computer and your Account; (e) Promptly notify us if you
discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Account.

9.2. You hereby accept and acknowledge that you take responsibility for all
activities that occur under your Account and accept all risks of any authorized
or unauthorized access to your Account, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 10. The Steemit Services

10.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things,
provide in software that facilitates the submission of STEEM transaction data
to the Steem Network without requiring you to access the STEEM command line
interface.

10.2. Account Names and Private Keys. If you create an Account through Steemit,
the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair
that you may use to send and receive STEEM and Steem Dollars via the Steem
Network, provided however, that you may create an account to the Steem
blockchain outside the bounds of the Steemit. The Private Key or Keys uniquely
match the Account Name and must be used in connection with the Account Name to
authorize the transfer of STEEM and Steem Dollars from that Account. You are
solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Private Keys and any
password phrase associated with your Account. You must keep your Account,
password phrase and Private Key access information secure. Failure to do so may
result in the loss of control of Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollars
associated with your Account.

10.3. No Password Retrieval. The Company does not receive or store your Account
password, nor your Private Keys. Therefore, we cannot assist you with Account
password retrieval, reset, or recovery. You are solely responsible for
remembering your Account password. If you have not safely stored a backup of
any Account Names and password pairs maintained in your Account, you accept and
acknowledge that any STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power you have associated
with such Account will become permanently inaccessible if you do not have your
Account password.

10.4.  Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Steem transactions
must be confirmed and recorded in the Steem public ledger via the Steem
distributed consensus network (a peer-to-peer economic network that operates on
a cryptographic protocol), which is not owned, controlled or operated by the
Company. The Steem Network is operated by a decentralized network of
independent third parties. The Company has no control over the Steem Network
and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you
submit via the Services will be confirmed via the Steem Network. You
acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services
may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Steem Network.
You may use the Services to submit these details to the network.

10.5.  No Storage or Transmission of STEEM, Steem Dollars or Steem Power.
Steem, in any of its forms (STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power) is an
intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the ownership record
maintained in the Steem Network. The Service does not store, send or receive
Steem. Any transfer of title that might occur in any STEEM, Steem Dollars or
Steem Power occurs on the decentralized ledger within the Steem Network and not
within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service can affect the
transfer of title or right in any Steem, Steem Dollars or Steem Power.

10.6.  Relationship. Nothing in these Terms is intended to nor shall create any
partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy or trusteeship, you and the
Company being with respect to one another independent contractors.

10.7. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information
you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and
acknowledge that the Company is not responsible for any errors or omissions
that you make in connection with any Steem transaction initiated via the
Services, for instance, if you mistype an Account Name or otherwise provide
incorrect information. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction
details carefully before completing them via the Services.

10.8. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been
submitted to the Steem Network via the Services, The Services cannot assist you
to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. The Company has no
control over the Steem Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any
cancellation or modification requests.

10.9. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply
to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via
the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax
to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that the Company is not responsible
for determining whether taxes apply to your Steem transactions or for
collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any
Steem transactions.

## 11. Fees for Using the Steemit Services

11.1. Company Fees Creating an Account. The Company does not currently charge
fees for any Services, however we reserve the right to do so in future, and in
such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any Service
to which a fee applies.

## 12. No Right To Cancel And/Or Reverse Steem Transactions

12.1. If you use a Service to which Steem, Steem Dollars or Steem Power is
transacted, you will not be able to change your mind once you have confirmed
that you wish to proceed with the Service or transaction.

## 13. Discontinuation of Services.

13.1. We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or without
prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or
permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely responsible for
storing, outside of the Services, a backup of any Account and Private Key pair
that you maintain in your Account.

13.2. If you do not maintain a backup of your Account data outside of the
Services, you will be may not be able to access Steem, Steem Dollars and Steem
Power associated with any Account Name maintained in your Account in the event
that we discontinue or deprecate the Services.

## 14. Suspension or Termination of Service.

14.1. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services in our sole
discretion, immediately and without prior notice, and delete or deactivate your
Account and all related information and files in such without cost to you,
including, for instance, in the event that you breach any term of these Terms.
In the event of termination, your access to funds will depend on your access to
your backup of your Account data including your Account Name and Private Keys.

## 15. User Conduct

15.1. When accessing or using the Services, you agree that you will not commit
any unlawful act, and that you are solely responsible for your conduct while
using our Services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree
that you will not:

15.1.1. Use of our Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt,
negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying our Services, or
that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of our
Services in any manner;

15.1.2.  Use our Services to pay for, support or otherwise engage in any

## 16. Third-Party Content and Sites

The Company may include links and other content owned or operated by third
parties, including advertisements and social “widgets” (we call these
“Third-Party Content”). You agree that the Company is not responsible or liable
for Third-Party Content and that you access and use Third-Party Content at your
own risk. Your interactions with Third-Party Content are solely between you and
the third party providing the content. When you leave Steemit, you should
understand that these Terms no longer govern and that the terms and policies of
those third-party sites or services will then apply.

## 17. Feedback

You may submit questions, comments, feedback, suggestions, and other
information regarding Steemit (we call this “Feedback”). You acknowledge and
agree that Feedback is non-confidential and will become the sole property of
the Company. The Company shall own exclusive rights, including, without
limitation, all intellectual property rights, in and to such Feedback and is
entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of this Feedback for any
purpose, without acknowledgment or compensation to you. You agree to execute
any documentation required by the Company to confirm such assignment to the
Company.

## 18. Copyright Complaints, the DMCA, and Takedowns

18.1 We will respond to legitimate requests under the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act ("DMCA"), and we retain the right to remove access to user

others. If you become aware of user content on Steemit that infringes your
copyright rights, you may submit a properly formatted DMCA request (see 17
U.S.C. § 512) to Steemit.

to the DMCA. A DMCA request can be sent to us via the contact information
below:

user content to the site.

It is Steemit's policy to deny use of the Service to users we identify as
repeat infringers. We apply this policy at our discretion and in appropriate
circumstances, such as when a user has repeatedly been charged with infringing
the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others.

## 19. Indemnity

All the things you do and all the information you submit or post to Steemit
remain your responsibility. Indemnity is basically a way of saying that you
will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that
infringe the law or the rights of a third party or person in any way.

Specifically, you agree to hold Steemit, its affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents, and third party service providers harmless from and defend
them against any claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses, and any other
liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to
your access to or use of Steemit, your violation of this user agreement, and/or
your violation of the rights of any third party or person.

## 20. Disclaimers

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Steemit and the Steemit
content are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranties
of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, implied
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
non-infringement and any warranties implied by any course of performance or
usage of trade. The company does not represent or warrant that Steemit and the
Steemit content: (a) will be secure or available at any particular time or
location; (b) are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free or that
any defects or errors will be corrected; and (c) are free of viruses or other
harmful components. Your use of Steemit and the Steemit content is solely at
your own risk. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied terms
in contracts with consumers, so some or all of the disclaimers in this section
may not apply to you.

## 21. Limitation of liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the
company or the any related party to the company, that includes but is not
limited to, subsidiaries, vendors, or contractors, be liable for any special,
indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages, or any
other damages of any kind, including, but not limited to, loss of use, loss of
profits or loss of data, whether in an action in contract, tort (including, but
not limited to, negligence) or otherwise, arising out of, or in any way
connected with, the use of, or inability to use, Steemit or the Steemit

content; or (b) these terms exceed any compensation you pay, if any, to the
company for access to or use of Steemit.

so some or all of the exclusions and limitations in this section may not apply
to you.

## 22. Modifications to Steemit

The Company reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or
permanently, Steemit, or any features or portions of Steemit, without prior
notice. You agree that the Company will not be liable for any modification,
suspension or discontinuance of Steemit, or any part of Steemit.

## 23. Arbitration

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
arbitrate certain disputes with Steemit and limits the manner in which you can
seek relief from Steemit.

23.1. Binding Arbitration

Except for disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action
in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the
alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade
secrets or patents, you and the Company: (a) waive your right to have any and
all disputes or Claims arising from these Terms or the Company (collectively,
“Disputes”) resolved in a court; and (b) waive your right to a jury trial.
Instead, you and the Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding
arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged
with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to
resolve it, instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

23.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions

You and the company agree that any dispute is personal to you and Steemit and
that any such dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration
and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type
of representative proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration or to
an arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a
representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and
Steemit agree that a dispute cannot be brought as a class, or other type of
representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf
of any other individual or group of individuals.

23.3. Federal Arbitration Act

You and the Company agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that
the enforceability of this Section 14 shall be governed by, construed and
enforced, both substantively and procedurally, by the Federal Arbitration Act,
9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law.

23.4. Process

You and the Company agree that you will notify each other in writing of any
Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can
attempt, in good faith, to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to the
Company shall be provided by sending an email to legal@steemit.com. Your notice
must include: (1) your name, postal address, and email address; (2) a
description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and (3) the specific relief
that you are seeking. If you and the Company cannot agree how to resolve the
Dispute within thirty (30) days of the Company receiving the notice, either you
or Company may, as appropriate pursuant to this Section 14, commence an
arbitration proceeding or file a claim in court. You and the Company agree that
any arbitration or claim must be commenced or filed within one (1) year after
the Dispute arose; otherwise, you and the Company agree that the claim is
permanently barred (which means that you will no longer have the right to
assert a claim regarding the Dispute). You and the Company agree that: (a) any
arbitration will occur in New York County, New York; (b) arbitration will be
conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of
JAMS; and (c) the state or federal courts in New York will have exclusive
jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award and over any Dispute
between the parties that is not subject to arbitration. You may also litigate a
Dispute in small claims court located in the county where you reside if the
Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.

23.5. Authority of Arbitrator

As limited by the FAA, these Terms and applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator
will have: (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural
and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute; and (b) the authority to grant
any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. The arbitrator may only
conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one
individual’ s claims, preside over any type of class or representative
proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

23.6. Rules of JAMS

The rules of, and additional information about, JAMS are available on the
JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com/, as may be updated from time to
time. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either: (a) acknowledge
and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS; or (b) waive
your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of
JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

23.7. Severability

If any term, clause or provision of this Section 14 is held invalid or
unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law and
all other terms, clauses or provisions will remain valid and enforceable.
Further, the waivers set forth in Section 24.2 are severable from the other
provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as
prohibited by applicable law.

## 24. Applicable Law and Venue

These Terms and your access to and use of Steemit and the Steemit Content
will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of New
York, without resort to its conflict of law provisions. To the extent the
arbitration provision in Section 14 does not apply and the Dispute cannot
be heard in small claims court, you agree that any action at law or in
equity arising out of, or relating to, these Terms shall be filed only in
the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York and you
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out
of these Terms.

## 25. Termination

The Company reserves the right, without notice and in our sole discretion,
to terminate your license to access and use Steemit and to block or prevent
your future access to, and use of, Steemit.

## 26. Severability

If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is deemed to be unlawful,
void or for any reason unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision
shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the
validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## 27. Changes

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and us concerning
Steemit. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you
and us. We may modify this user agreement at any time. If we make changes
to this agreement that materially affect your rights, we will provide
advance notice and keep this edition available as an archive on the Steemit
website. By continuing to use Steemit after a change to this agreement, you
agree to those changes.

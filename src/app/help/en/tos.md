## 9. The Services

9.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things,
provide software that facilitates the submission of Steem blockchain
transaction data to the Steem blockchain without requiring you to access the
Steem blockchain command line interface.

9.2. Account and Private Keys. Should you agree to create an Account through
our Service, we generate a cryptographic private and public key pair that are
provided solely to you and completely owned by you; provided however that we
not store passwords or Private Keys for our you.  We never have access to your
Private Key and do not custody any Private Keys on your behalf, and therefore,
assume no responsibility for the management of the Private Key tied to your
Account.  The Private Key uniquely match the Account name and must be used in
connection with the Account to authorize the transfer of STEEM and Steem
Dollars from that Account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the
security of your Private Keys. You must keep your Private Key access
information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of
STEEM, Steem Power and Steem Dollars associated with your Account.

9.3. No Password Retrieval. We do not receive or store your Account password or
Private Keys. Your Private Key is your own and you are solely responsible for
their safekeeping.  We cannot assist you with Account password retrieval,
reset, or recovery. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account
password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Account and password
pairs maintained in your Account, you accept and acknowledge that any STEEM,
Steem Dollars and Steem Power you have associated with such Account will become
permanently inaccessible if you do not have your Account password.

9.4.  Transactions. All proposed Steem blockchain transactions must be
confirmed and recorded in the Steem blockchain via the Steem distributed
consensus network (a peer-to-peer network), which is not owned, controlled, or
operated by us. The Steem blockchain is operated by a decentralized network of
independent third parties. We have no control over the Steem blockchain and
therefore cannot and will not ensure that any transaction details you submit
via the Services will be confirmed on the Steem blockchain. You acknowledge and
agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be
completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Steem blockchain. You may
use the Services to submit these details to the Steem blockchain.

9.5.  No Storage or Transmission of STEEM, Steem Dollars or Steem Power. STEEM,
in any of its forms (STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem Power) is an intangible,
digital asset controlled by you.  These assets exist only by virtue of the
ownership record maintained on the Steem blockchain. The Service does not
store, send, or receive STEEM, Steem Dollars, or Steem Power. Any transfer of
title that might occur in any STEEM, Steem Dollars or Steem Power occurs on the
Steem blockchain and not within the Services. We do not guarantee that the
Service can affect the transfer of title or right in any STEEM, Steem Dollars
or Steem Power.

9.6.  Relationship. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to nor shall create
any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy, or trusteeship, between
you and us.

9.7. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information
you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and
acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you
make in connection with any Steem blockchain transaction initiated via the
Services, for instance, if you mistype an Account name or otherwise provide
incorrect information. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction
details carefully before completing them via the Services.

9.8. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been
submitted to the Steem blockchain via the Services, The Services cannot assist
you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. We have no control
over the Steem blockchain and do not have the ability to facilitate any
cancellation or modification requests.

9.9. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to
the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via the
Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to
the appropriate tax authority. You agree that the we are not responsible for
determining whether taxes apply to your Steem blockchain transactions or for
collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any
Steem blockchain transactions.

## 10. Fees for Using the Services

10.1. Fees Creating an Account. We do not currently charge fees for any
Services in connection with the creation of Accounts, however we reserve the
right to do so in future, and in such case any applicable fees will be
displayed prior to you using any Service to which a fee applies.

## 11. No Right to Cancel And/or Reverse Steem Transactions

11.1. If you use a Service to which STEEM, Steem Dollars or Steem Power is
transacted, you will not be able to change your mind once you have confirmed
that you wish to proceed with the Service or transaction.

## 12. Discontinuation of Services.

12.1. We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or without
prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or
permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely responsible for
storing, outside of the Services, a backup of any Account and Private Key that
you maintain in your Account.

12.2. If you do not maintain a backup of your Account data outside of the
Services, you may not be able to access STEEM, Steem Dollars and Steem
Power associated with your Account if we discontinue or deprecate the Services.

## 13. Suspension or Termination of Service.

13.1. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services in our sole
discretion, immediately and without prior notice, and delete or deactivate your
steemit.com account and all related information and files in such without cost
to you, including, for instance, if you breach any term of this Agreement. In
the event of termination, your access to the funds in your account will require
you access to the Steem blockchain via the command line API or third party
tool, and will require you to have access to your backup of your Account data
including your Account and Private Keys.

## 14. User Conduct

14.1. When accessing or using the Services, you agree that you will not commit
any unlawful act, and that you are solely responsible for your conduct while

## 20. Arbitration

Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
arbitrate certain disputes with Steemit, Inc. and limits the way you can seek
relief from Steemit, Inc. If you do not agree with this Section 20, please
discontinue using the Service.

20.1. Binding Arbitration. Except for disputes in which either party seeks to
bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other
equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade
names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Steemit, Inc.: (a) waive your
right to have any and all disputes or Claims arising from this Agreement or
Steemit, Inc. (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in a court; and (b) waive
your right to a jury trial. Instead, you and Steemit, Inc. will arbitrate
Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one
or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and
binding determination to resolve it, instead of having the Dispute decided by a
judge or jury in court).

20.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. You agree
that any dispute is personal to you and Steemit, Inc. and that any such dispute
will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought
as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative
proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration or to an arbitration in
which an individual makes and attempt to resolve a dispute as a representative
of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and Steemit, Inc.
agree that a dispute cannot be brought as a class, or other type of
representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf
of any other individual or group of individuals.

20.3. Federal Arbitration Act. You agree that this Agreement affects interstate
commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 20 shall be governed by,
construed, and enforced, both substantively and procedurally, by the Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”) to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law.

20.4. Process. You agree that you will notify us in writing of any Dispute
within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can attempt, in
good faith, to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to the us shall be
provided by sending an email to legal@steemit.com. Your notice must include:
(1) your name, postal address, and email address; (2) a description of the
nature or basis of the Dispute; and (3) the specific relief that you are
seeking. If we cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days
of the us receiving the notice, either you or Steemit, Inc. may, as appropriate
pursuant to this Section 20, commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim
in court. You agree that any arbitration or claim against us must be commenced
or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose; otherwise, you agree that
the claim is permanently barred (which means that you will no longer have the
right to assert a claim regarding the Dispute). You have read, understand, and
agree that: (a) any arbitration will occur in New York County, New York; (b)
arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in
accordance with the rules of JAMS; and (c) the state or federal courts in New
York will have exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration
award and over any Dispute between the parties that is not subject to
arbitration. You may also litigate a Dispute in small claims court located in
the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard
in small claims court.

20.5. Authority of Arbitrator. As limited by the FAA, this Agreement and
applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have: (a) the exclusive authority
and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a
Dispute; and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be
available in court. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration
and may not consolidate more than one individual’ s claims, preside over any
type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding
involving more than one individual.

20.6. Rules of JAMS. The rules of, and additional information about, JAMS are
available on the JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com/, as may be updated
from time to time. By agreeing to be bound by this Agreement, you either: (a)
acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS; or
(b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the
rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

20.7. Severability. If any term, clause, or provision of this Section 20 is
held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent
required by law and all other terms, clauses or provisions will remain valid
and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 20.2 are severable
from the other provisions of this Agreement and will remain valid and
enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.

## 21. Applicable Law and Venue

This Agreement and your access to and use of the Service and the Steemit
Content will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of New
York, without resort to its conflict of law provisions. To the extent the
arbitration provision in Section 20 does not apply and the Dispute cannot be
heard in small claims court, you agree that any action at law or in equity
arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement shall be filed only in the state
and federal courts located in New York County, New York and you hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of
this Agreement.

## 22. Termination

We reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate
your license to access and use of the Service, which includes, steemit.com, and
to block or prevent your future access to, and use of, the Service that we
provide.

## 23. Severability

If any term, clause, or provision of this Agreement is deemed to be unlawful,
void or for any reason unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision shall
be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and
enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## 24. Changes

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and us concerning the
Service. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and
us. We may modify this user agreement at any time. If we make changes to this
agreement that materially affect your rights, we will provide notice and keep

            "Recover an account to a new authority using a previous authority and verification of the recovery account as proof of identity. This operation can only succeed if there was a recovery request sent by the account's recover account. In order to recover the account, the account holder must provide proof of past ownership and proof of identity to the recovery account. Being able to satisfy an owner authority that was used in the past 30 days is sufficient to prove past ownership. The get_owner_history function in the database API returns past owner authorities that are valid for account recovery. Proving identity is an off chain contract between the account holder and the recovery account. The recovery request contains a new authority which must be satisfied by the account holder to regain control. The actual process of verifying authority may become complicated, but that is an application level concern, not a blockchain concern. This operation requires both the past and future owner authorities in the operation because neither of them can be derived from the current chain state. The operation must be signed by keys that satisfy both the new owner authority and the recent owner authority. Failing either fails the operation entirely. If a recovery request was made inadvertantly, the account holder should contact the recovery account to have the request deleted. The two setp combination of the account recovery request and recover is safe because the recovery account never has access to secrets of the account to recover. They simply act as an on chain endorsement of off chain identity. In other systems, a fork would be required to enforce such off chain state. Additionally, an account cannot be permanently recovered to the wrong account. While any owner authority from the past 30 days can be used, including a compromised authority, the account can be continually recovered until the recovery account is confident a combination of uncompromised authorities were used to recover the account. The actual process of verifying authority may become complicated, but that is an application level concern, not the blockchain's concern.",

It is the responsibility of the recovery account to verify the identity of the account holder of the account to recover by whichever means they have agreed upon. The blockchain assumes identity has been verified when this operation is broadcast. This operation creates an account recovery request which the account to recover has 24 hours to respond to before the request expires and is invalidated. There can only be one active recovery request per account at any one time. Pushing this operation for an account to recover when it already has an active request will either update the request to a new new owner authority and extend the request expiration to 24 hours from the current head block time or it will delete the request. To cancel a request, simply set the weight threshold of the new owner authority to 0, making it an open authority. Additionally, the new owner authority must be satisfiable. In other words, the sum of the key weights must be greater than or equal to the weight threshold. This operation only needs to be signed by the the recovery account.
